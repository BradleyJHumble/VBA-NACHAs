# Make-NACHAs
VBA Script for making NACHA files 


This script assumes that the data for the entry detail records is located in column A (Routing Number), column B (Account Number), column C (Amount), and column D (Individual Name) of the worksheet named "Sheet1". You may need to modify the script to match the layout of your data. Additionally, you will need to modify the header information in the script to match your specific NACHA file requirements.
